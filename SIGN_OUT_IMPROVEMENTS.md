# Sign Out Process Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the sign out process to ensure proper session management and prevent data leakage between user accounts.

## Problem Statement

Previously, users reported experiencing cached data from previous accounts after signing out and logging in with a new account. This indicated that the sign out process wasn't properly clearing all application caches and state.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incomplete Cache Clearing**: Only basic localStorage caches were being cleared
2. **Timing Issues**: Role context cleanup had a 100ms delay that might not be sufficient
3. **Missing Global Cleanup**: No centralized sign out handler to coordinate all contexts
4. **Browser Storage**: HTTP caches, IndexedDB, and cookies weren't being cleared
5. **Context State**: Some React contexts weren't fully resetting their state

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Cache Clearing Utility (`clearAllUserCaches`)

Located in `src/lib/utils.ts`, this function clears:
- localStorage items with specific prefixes (exgen_, clerk_, user_, auth_, role_, credit_, etc.)
- sessionStorage completely
- HTTP caches via the Cache API
- IndexedDB databases with relevant names
- Next.js data cache
- Accessible cookies with relevant prefixes

### 2. Custom Sign Out Hook (`useSignOut`)

Located in `src/hooks/use-sign-out.ts`, this hook:
- Coordinates the entire sign out process
- Ensures cache clearing happens before Clerk sign out
- Provides fallback mechanisms if errors occur
- Logs the entire process for debugging

### 3. Global Sign Out Event System

Implemented across all contexts:
- `ClerkErrorBoundary` dispatches a `user-signed-out` custom event
- All contexts listen for this event and perform additional cleanup
- Ensures coordination between different parts of the application

### 4. Enhanced Context Cleanup

**RoleContext**: 
- Aborts ongoing requests
- Clears role cache
- Resets all state to initial values
- Responds to global sign out events

**CreditContext**:
- Clears credit data and API token cache
- Resets loading states and retry counters
- Clears callback references
- Responds to global sign out events

### 5. Improved Header Component

The `UnifiedHeader` now:
- Uses the custom sign out hook
- Ensures complete cleanup before Clerk processes sign out
- Provides better error handling and logging

## How It Works

1. **User clicks sign out** in the UserButton
2. **Custom sign out handler** is triggered
3. **Cache clearing utility** removes all user-specific data
4. **Global sign out event** is dispatched to notify all contexts
5. **All contexts** perform their cleanup routines
6. **Clerk sign out** is executed
7. **User is redirected** to the homepage

## Benefits

1. **Complete Data Isolation**: No user data persists between sessions
2. **Better Security**: Prevents data leakage between accounts
3. **Improved UX**: Users don't see cached data from previous accounts
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure sign out always works

## Testing the Improvements

To verify the improvements work:

1. **Sign in** with one account
2. **Navigate** to various pages to generate cached data
3. **Sign out** using the UserButton
4. **Check browser console** for cleanup logs
5. **Sign in** with a different account
6. **Verify** no data from the previous account is visible

## Monitoring and Debugging

The improved system provides extensive logging:
- üîê Sign out process steps
- üóëÔ∏è Cache clearing operations
- üîî Global event notifications
- ‚úÖ Success confirmations
- ‚ùå Error details

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. **Sign out analytics** to track usage patterns
2. **Automatic cleanup** for abandoned sessions
3. **Cache expiration** policies for better performance
4. **User feedback** collection for sign out experience

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check browser console** for error logs
2. **Verify** all contexts are receiving the global sign out event
3. **Test** with different browsers and devices
4. **Clear browser data** manually as a last resort
5. **Use** the `forcePageRefresh()` utility for complete reset

## Conclusion

The improved sign out process ensures complete session isolation and prevents the data leakage issues that users were experiencing. The multi-layered approach provides redundancy and reliability while maintaining good performance.
