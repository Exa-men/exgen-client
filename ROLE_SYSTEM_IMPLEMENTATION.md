# Role System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a three-tier role system for the exgen application:
- **User**: Basic user functionality
- **Admin**: Administrative permissions (reduced from previous admin role)
- **Owner**: Full system access (previous admin permissions)

## Backend Changes (exgen-server)

### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `migrations/versions/a1dd2110ccdf_add_owner_role_and_role_hierarchy.py`
- **Change**: Added database constraint to ensure role column only accepts 'user', 'admin', or 'owner'

### 2. Authentication System Updates
- **File**: `src/auth.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `require_admin()` to allow both admin and owner roles
  - Added `require_owner()` function for owner-only access
  - Added `has_role_or_higher()` helper function for role hierarchy
  - Added `require_role_or_higher()` decorator for flexible role requirements

### 3. API Endpoint Updates
- **File**: `src/main.py`
- **Owner-only endpoints**:
  - Credit order fulfillment (`/api/v1/admin/credits/orders/{order_id}/fulfill`)
  - Credit order status updates (`/api/v1/admin/credits/orders/{order_id}/status`)
  - User credit updates (`/api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}/credits`)
  - User email updates (`/api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}/email`)
  - Credit package management (create, update, delete)
  - System configuration management

- **Admin+Owner endpoints**:
  - User role updates (with restrictions: admins cannot promote to owner)
  - User listing and viewing
  - Credit order viewing (but not fulfillment)

### 4. Catalog API Updates
- **File**: `src/catalog_api.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Product creation: Admin+Owner access
  - Product deletion: Owner-only access
  - Product editing: Admin+Owner access

## Frontend Changes (exgen-client)

### 1. Role Hook Updates
- **File**: `src/hooks/use-role.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added support for 'owner' role
  - Added `isOwner` and `hasOwnerAccess` helper functions
  - Added `hasAdminAccess` function (admin or owner)

### 2. Role Guard Component Updates
- **File**: `src/components/RoleGuard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added support for 'owner' role in allowed roles
  - Added `OwnerOnly` convenience component
  - Updated `AdminOnly` to allow both admin and owner roles

### 3. Navigation Updates
- **File**: `src/app/components/UnifiedHeader.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Users page: Admin+Owner access
  - Credit Orders, Vouchers, System, Analytics: Owner-only access
  - Applied to both desktop and mobile navigation

### 4. User Management Page Updates
- **File**: `src/app/users/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added support for 'owner' role in role selection
  - Email editing: Owner-only access
  - Credit editing: Owner-only access
  - Role promotion to owner: Owner-only access
  - Added 'Owners' filter option

### 5. Catalog Management Updates
- **File**: `src/app/catalogus/edit/[productId]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Product deletion: Owner-only access
  - Danger zone section: Owner-only visibility

## Role Hierarchy

```
User (1) < Admin (2) < Owner (3)
```

### Permission Breakdown

#### Owner Permissions (High-stake actions)
- All current admin permissions
- Manage credit packages (create, update, delete)
- Issue credits to users directly
- Modify user email addresses
- Fulfill credit orders
- System-wide configuration changes
- Analytics access
- Delete products

#### Admin Permissions (Administrative tasks)
- View all users
- Add new exam products
- Manage product versions and content
- View credit orders (but not fulfill them)
- Basic system monitoring
- User role management (but not to owner)

#### User Permissions (unchanged)
- Purchase products
- Use workflows
- Manage own credits
- Submit feedback

## Security Features

1. **Role Validation**: Database constraint ensures only valid roles
2. **Self-Protection**: Users cannot change their own role
3. **Hierarchy Enforcement**: Admins cannot promote users to owner
4. **API Protection**: Backend validates all role-based access
5. **Frontend Protection**: UI elements hidden based on role

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Migration**: Verify constraint is applied
2. **API Testing**: Test all endpoints with different roles
3. **UI Testing**: Verify correct elements show/hide based on role
4. **Security Testing**: Ensure role escalation is prevented
5. **Edge Cases**: Test role changes and permission inheritance

## Migration Notes

- Existing admin users retain their admin role
- New owner role must be manually assigned
- All existing functionality preserved for backward compatibility
- Database migration is backward compatible
